#Project Overview:
This project will involve creating a machine learning pipeline with Data Version Control (DVC) and CI/CD integration using GitHub Actions. The overall goal is to automatically train a model when new data is pushed to your remote storage (S3). Here’s an outline of the project’s scope:

**Version Control with Git**: We will initialize a Git repository to store our project files.
**Virtual Environment with .venv**: We will use a Python virtual environment to isolate our project dependencies.
**DVC for Data Management**: We will track our datasets with DVC and store them in a remote (S3 in this case).
**CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions**: We will automate the process of training the model whenever new data is pushed to the repository or remote storage (S3).
